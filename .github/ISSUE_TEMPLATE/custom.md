Please use this site only for reporting developer-level problems, not user-level problems, such as installation issues, or questions about how to use the software. For User level discussions, please use the Google Group:

We feel it is important to archive all user-level questions on one site, so we will not respond to user-level questions posted on GitHub. For developer-level problems, such as suggesting code alterations, or reporting identified bugs at the code level, you may use this issue tracker. For discussions you prefer not to make public, feel free to email sludtke@bcm.edu directly.
