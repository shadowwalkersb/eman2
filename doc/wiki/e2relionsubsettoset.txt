usage: prog [options] <relion STAR file> <output set name>

This program will take a STAR file representing a subset of data from a Relion project and convert it into an EMAN2
set, IF the EMAN2 project contains the same micrographs and exact same boxed out particles as the Relion project
which produced the STAR file. e2refinetoeman.py can be used to convert an entire Relion project into an EMAN2
project. This program can then be used in this established project to copy information about particle subsets
selected in Relion into EMAN2.
