{{{

usage: prog [options] <command> <file A> ...
	
Performs various options with basis sets, such as the orthogonal
basis produced by e2msa.py. 

project <basis input> <image input> <projection output>
	Projects a set of images into the input basis subspace. The default
	is to normalize the individual basis vectors, but not the final resulting
	projection. The projections are stored as a 1-D image stack.
	
projectrot <basis input> <image input> <simmx input> <projection output>
	Same as project, except it will rotate/translate the particles based on the
	best match found in simmx before projection.

||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--normproj|| ||Normalize the projections resulting from 'project', such that the length of each vector is 1||
||--normcomponent|| ||Normalize the dot product for each component of the output vector. If the basis spans the input vector, then the projected vector length will be 1, otherwise it will be less than 1.||
||--normalize||str||Normalize the input images using the named processor. Specify 'tomean' for mean-based scaling. Specify None to disable.||
||--mask||int||Mask radius||
||--maskfile, -M||str||File containing a mask to apply to the particles before normalization||
||--mean1|| ||Indicates that the first image in the basis set is actually the mean image, which should be subtracted prior to projection. Output from e2msa requires this flag.||
||--recalcmean|| ||This will recompute the mean from the input set and subtract before projection. Useful if a different normalization is used than in the original basis file.||
||--txtout|| ||Output will be a multicolumn text file suitable for plotting||
||--oneout|| ||Output is a single 2-D image rather than a set of 1-D images||
||--nbasis, -n||int||Will use the first n basis images from the input, excluding the mean if present||
||--basislist, -z||str||List of basis vectors to use, comma delimited.||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higher number means higher level of verboseness||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
