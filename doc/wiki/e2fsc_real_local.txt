usage: e2fsc.py [options] input1 input2

Simple 2 volume FSCs can be computed with e2proc3d.py. In addition to the overall fsc (saved to fsc.txt), 
it also computes a "local resolution" through the volume. These local resolutions are based on poor statistics.
The smaller the box size, the worse they are, and this is not taken into account when computing actual
resolution values. Regardless, it will give a reasonable comparison of how much variation exists in different
regions of the map, and will produce locally filtered maps with a reasonable level of detail, given the two
input volumes.
