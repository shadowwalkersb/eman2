{{{

usage: Usage: e2enrich.py <sets/particles.lst> [options]
This program will enrich each particle in a SPA project by averaging it with N similar particles. 
The additional particles are identified using an MSA subspace of the bispectra, which makes the process
fast enough to be practical. This program is best used with a set containing reasonably reliable 
particles, to avoid "bad particle" contamination. Particles must have run through standard ctf
autoprocessing prior to using this program, but no other processing is required. Suggest running this on
'fullres' particles.
