usage: prog [options]

This program runs a set of speed tests on the current machine

This program runs a set of speed tests in the current computer. It should
have at least 1 unloaded processor, and minimal i/o occurring when this
is run. It will give a single value which should be generally proportional
to how fast single particle refinement will run on a given computer. It is a 'real world' test,
in that it tests a variety of actual operations performed by a
refinement procedure. Don't compare values given by speed test in
different versions of EMAN, since the underlying routines may be
improved with time.
