usage: prog [options] [classes file]
	This program will go through a standard classes file (containing EMAN2-generated class-averages), and extract the
particles associated with one or more class-averages. Some similar tasks can be performed graphically with e2evalparticles.py.
This program is used by e2refinemulti to extract particles associated with each of the output volumes for subsequent
single-model refinement.

There are 3 mutually exclusive modes in this program:
	--refinemulti - Extracts the particles associated with each of the output 3-D maps generated by an e2refinemulti run
	--classlist - Extracts references to all of the particles in a user specified list of class numbers (the list of integers is in a text file)
	--orientedparticles - Extracts rotated/translated particles associated with each class-average into a separate stack (also requires --orientcls)
	
Examples:
Extract all of the 2-D aligned even and odd particles associated with a specific class-average:
e2classextract.py --orientcls refine_03/cls_result_04 --orientedparticles sets/all_ctf_flip_fullres --evenoddmerge --orientclassn 248

||option||type||description||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--refinemulti|| ||Extracts particles based on the model_id header value in each class-average, normally produced by e2refinemulti||
||--classlist||str||Filename of a text file containing a (comma or whitespace separated) list of class average numbers to operate on. ||
||--orientedparticles||str||Filename of the set (.lst file) with the particles used for the --orientcls file||
||--orientcls||str||Filename of a cls_result_xx or classmx_xx file. ||
||--orientclassn||str||Specify a comma separated list of class numbers to extract in oriented particles mode.||
||--input_set||str||Normally the set used to create the class-averages is used as input. Use this with another version of the same set of particles, for example '__ctf_flip_proc' instead of '__ctf_flip' ||
||--setname||str||Name of the stack to build||
||--evenoddmerge|| ||with --orientedparticles, if cls_result_xx is specified, will include both _even and _odd particles in the output.||
||--excludebad|| ||Excludes the particles from the generated set(s). They are included by default.||
||--noderef|| ||If particle file was .lst, normally the output .lst will reference the original image file. With this option, the output will reference the .lst file instead, creating a lst pointing to another lst.||
||--sort|| ||If set, output .lst file will be sorted. The default is to leave the output grouped by class-average. If (and only if) sorted, duplicate entries will be removed.||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higher number means higher level of verboseness||
