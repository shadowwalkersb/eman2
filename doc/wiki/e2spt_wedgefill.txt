|| ||fillwithnoise||bool||this will fill the missing wedge with gaussian noise. --matchto will be turned on by default if this option is supplied.||
|| ||matchto||bool||this will match the power spectrum of each image in --input to that --fillimage so that things are properly normalized.||
|| ||path||string||Directory to store results in. The default is a numbered series of directories containing the prefix 'spttransformplot'; for example, spttransformplot_02 will be the directory by default if 'spttransformplot_01' already exists.||
|| ||ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
|| ||subset||int||Default=0 (not used). Plot only this substet of transforms from the hdf stack or json file provided.||
