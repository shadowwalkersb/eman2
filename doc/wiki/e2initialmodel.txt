{{{

usage: prog [options]
	This program will take a set of reference-free class-averages (or other projections) and generate a set of possible
	3-D initial models. It does this by heavily downsampling the data, then running a number of very fast, full iterative
	refinements, each seeded with a random starting model. The results are sorted in order of apparent agreement with the
	data, such that at the end, the first numbered model should be the best result. Ideally the top few answers will all
	qualtitatively agree on the overall structure. If they do not, the results should be thoroughly assessed manually to
	insure a sensible result. By default this routine will generate 10 initial models, but this may be fewer or more than
	is strictly necessary depending on a number of factors. If the data is highly structurally heterogeneous, particularly
	if combined with a strongly preferred orientation, a correct solution using this technique may not be possible, but
	for most situations it will work well. For other situations, single particle tomography presents a good alternative
	for generating initial models.
