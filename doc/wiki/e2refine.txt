e2refine.py is no longer functional in EMAN2.1 and above. Please use e2refine_easy.py instead.

Note: e2refine_easy does provide most of the same options as e2refine.py, but you should almost never 
specify most of them. There are a few required and optional parameters to specify. The rest are normally autoselected for you.
