{{{

usage: prog [options] --stackname myfile.hdf <image1> <image2> <image3> ...
	This program will combine many image files into a single output file. 
	
	If the output name has a ".lst" extension:
	the output is a formatted text file, one line per image, describing the file containing the actual
	image data in a searchable form. .lst files can be used as if they contained actual images in any
	EMAN2 programs.
	
	If the output is a normal image file (.hdf, .spi, etc.) then the images will be copied into the
	output file sequentially in the order provided on the command-line. Some file formats will not
	support multiple images, or multiple volumes. Appropriate errors will be raised in these cases.
	HDF is the only format supporting full metadata retention for stacks of images or volumes.
	
	The output file will be emptied and overwritten!
