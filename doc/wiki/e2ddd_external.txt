{{{

usage: prog [options] <ddd_movie_stacks>
	This program is a wrapper for various DDD alignment routines including:
		alignframes (IMOD)
		motioncor2 (UCSF)

	Note, this is a simple script that mainly uses default alignment parameters for each
	external program. It is mainly intended to make some external ddd alignment routines
	available from the EMAN2 GUI for streamlined processing. In order for this program to
	run, the alignment routine you wish to use must be installed and accessible via the PATH 
	environment variable. To customize alignment, you will need to run these programs 
	from the command line independently and import the aligned averages/tiltseries into 
	your EMAN2 project.

||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--program||str||Use this external program to align frames. Choose between imod_alignframes and ucsf_motioncor2. Note, programs must be accessible from your PATH environment variable.||
||--device||str||When possible, use this device to process movie frames. Default is gpu.||
||--mdoc||str||When an mdoc or idoc is provided, the raw files are automatically found within the input directory||
||--apix||float||Specify the Apix of the movies to be processed.||
||--dark||str||Use this dark reference.||
||--gain||str||Use this gain reference.||
||--defect_file||str||Specify the camera defects file.||
||--mc2_rotgain||int||Rotates the gain 90 degress counter clockwise X times. Rotation is applied before flipping.||
||--mc2_flipgain||int||A value of 1 flips gain image vertically, 2 flips gain image horizontally. Default is 0.||
||--imod_rotflipgain||int||Rotates the gain 90 degress counter clockwise X times. If value is greater than 3, gain image is flipped about the y axis before rotation.||
||--device_num||str||When possible, use this device to process movie frames. Default is GPU.||
||--binby||int||The degree of binning for final image. Default is 1, i.e. no binning. Note that this option takes only integer values.||
||--groupby||int||Before alignment, sum raw frames in groups of X to increase signal to noise ratio.||
||--first||int||The index of the leading frame to include in alignment.||
||--last||int||The index of the last frame to include in alignment.||
||--mc2_patchX||int||Use this many patches along X with MotionCor2. Default is 1, i.e. whole-frame alignment.||
||--mc2_patchY||int||Use this many patches along Y with MotionCor2. Default is 1, i.e. whole-frame alignment.||
||--tomo|| ||If checked, aligned frames will be placed in a tiltseries located in the 'tiltseries' directory. Otherwise, aligned sums will populate the 'micrographs_mrc' directory.||
||--tiltseries_name||str||Specify the name of the output tiltseries. A .mrc extension will be appended to the filename provided.||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
