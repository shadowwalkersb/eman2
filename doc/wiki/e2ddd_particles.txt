usage: prog [options] <refine_xx folder>

	WARNING: this program is still considered experimental!

	Based on a completed refinement, this will perform per-particle alignment using reference projections from the reconstruction.
	It will only perform alignments on particles used in the specified refinement run. 
	
	This will make an attempt to rename the original particles as *__orig before writing the new particles with the original particle
	names. It will do this only the first time. If __orig files already exist, it will not replace them. This way if you run this
	program multiple times, you can produce new versions of the aligned particles without destroying the true originals.
