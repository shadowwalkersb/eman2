usage: prog [options] <input stack> <output basis> [reprojections]
This too provides a variety of dimensionality reduction methods. This new version
uses scikit.learn, which provides a greater variety of algorithms, but must load 
all data into memory. If working with a large file, you may want to consider using
--step to operate on a limited subset of the data.

If specified, [reprojections] will contain projections of the full input stack
(ignoring --step) into the basis subspace represented as a single image. This 
obviates the need for e2basis.py, and permits use of nonlinear decompositions.

---
Performs multivariate statistical analysis on a stack of images. Writes
a set of Eigenimages which can be uses as a basis set for reducing
the dimensionality of a data set (noise reduction). Typically this
basis set is then used to reproject the data (e2basis.py) and
classify the data based on the projected vectors. If the
output file supports arbitrary metadata (like HDF), Eigenvalues
are stored in the 'eigval' parameter in each image.

Note: The mean value is subtracted from each image prior to MSA
calculation. The mean image is stored as the first image in the output
file, though it is not part of the orthonormal basis when
handled this way.
