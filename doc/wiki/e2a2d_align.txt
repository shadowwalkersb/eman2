|| ||threads||int||Number of alignment threads to run in parallel on a single computer||
|| ||iter||int||Iteration number within path. Default = start a new iteration||
|| ||goldstandard||float||If specified, will phase randomize the even and odd references past the specified resolution (in A, not 1/A)||
|| ||goldcontinue||bool||Will use even/odd refs corresponding to specified reference to continue refining without phase randomizing again||
|| ||saveali||bool||Save a stack file (aliptcls_XX.hdf) containing the aligned particles.||
|| ||path||string||Path to a folder where results should be stored, following standard naming conventions (default = 2da_XX)||
|| ||sym||string||Symmetry of the input. Must be aligned in standard orientation to work properly.||
|| ||align||string||This is the aligner used to align particles to the previous class average. Default is None.||
|| ||aligncmp||string||The comparitor used for the --align aligner. Default is dot.||
|| ||ralign||string||This is the second stage aligner used to refine the first alignment. This is usually the 'refine' aligner.||
|| ||raligncmp||string||The comparitor used by the second stage aligner.||
|| ||cmp||string||The comparitor used to generate quality scores for the purpose of particle exclusion in classes, strongly linked to the keep argument.||
||-v||verbose||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
|| ||ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
