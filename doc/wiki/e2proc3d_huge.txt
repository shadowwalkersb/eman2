{{{

usage: e2proc3d_huge.py [options] <inputfile>
	This is a specialized version of e2proc3d.py targeted at performing a limited set of operations on
very large volumes in-place (such as tomograms) which may not readily fit into system memory. Operations are 
performed by reading portions of the image, processing, then writing the portion back to disk. Unlike e2proc3d.py
you may pass only a single operation to the program for each invocation, or behavior will be undefined. It will 
process a single volume in a single file in-place.

||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--streaksubtract||str||This will subtract the histogram peak value along a single axis in the volume.||
||--process||str||apply a processor named 'processorname' with all its parameters/values. WARNING: this works by operating on fragments of the overall image at a time, and some processors won't work properly this way.||
||--mult||float||Scales the densities by a fixed number in the output||
||--multfile||str||Multiplies the volume by another volume of identical size. This can be used to apply masks, etc.||
||--add||float||Adds a constant 'f' to the densities||
||--trans||str||Translate map by dx,dy,dz ||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higher number means higher level of verboseness||
