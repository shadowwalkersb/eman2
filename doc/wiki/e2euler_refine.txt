|| ||input||bool||The input projections. Project should usually have the xform.projection header attribute, which is used for slice insertion||
|| ||ref_volume||bool||The reference volume for orientation determination.||
|| ||input_model||bool||If the class-averages have the model_id parameter (produced by e2refinemulti.py), this will use only class-averages with the specified model_id for the reconstruction.||
|| ||no_wt||bool||This argument turns automatic weighting off causing all images to be weighted by 1. If this argument is not specified images inserted into the reconstructed volume are weighted by the number of particles that contributed to them (i.e. as in class averages), which is extracted from the image header (as the ptcl_repr attribute).||
||-v||verbose||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
|| ||threads||int||Number of threads to run in parallel on a single computer. This is the only parallelism supported by e2make3dpar||
|| ||ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
