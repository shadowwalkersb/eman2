{{{

usage: prog [options]
	This program will take a set of reference-free class-averages (or other projections) and generate a set of possible
	3-D initial models. Unlike e2initialmodel.py this program relies on particles having high symmetry, and uses this
	to generate a more direct solution. It is typically used with icosahedral symmetry, but could also work with other
	high symmetries.

	WARNING: this program should not be used with high resolution data without downsampling. If you do it will take an 
	incredibly long time, and not really produce any better results. In most cases, class-averages generated 
	from _lp20 or _lp14 particles would be appropriate. Also, normally you would only use 3-10 class-averages 
	with this program.
