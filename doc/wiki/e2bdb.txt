usage: prog [options] <path or db> ...
	
Various utilities related to BDB databases.

examples :
e2bdb.py -c   Is perhaps the most critical function, as it cleans up the database cache. See the Wiki for more.
e2bdb.py <path> -s    will list the contents of the database in a directory in bdb: notation
e2bdb.py <path> -l    Will give useful summary info about stacks in a directory
e2bdb.py <database> --dump    Gives a mechanism to dump all of the metadata in a database, even if the database contains no images
