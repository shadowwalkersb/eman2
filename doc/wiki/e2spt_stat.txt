{{{

usage: Usage: e2spt_stat.py [options] 
Note that this program is not part of the original e2spt hierarchy, but is part of an experimental refactoring.

This program will look in an spt_XX folder at particle_parms_xx.json and show a quality histogram of the particles as compared to the alignment reference. Smaller values are better.
