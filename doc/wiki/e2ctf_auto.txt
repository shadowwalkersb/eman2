{{{

usage: prog [options]
This program automates the CTF fitting and structure factor generation process, which normally involves a
sequence of at least 4 different steps. For most projects, this will work correctly with no human intervention.
We strongly recommend running the GUI after it completes to double-check the fitting of a few of the closest
and a few of the furthest from focus images by hand.

If you detect fitting problems on any images, manually adjust those images to a defocus near the correct value,
then rerun this program (without --fromscratch) and the problem should be fixed.

For defocus with astigmatism fitting, whole frame fitting as implemented in e2rawdata.py and
e2evalimage.py generally produce superior fits. If you have run this whole-frame fitting, e2ctf_auto will
take this into account, and only fit the other required parameters.

Important: This program must be run from the project directory, not from within the particles directory
