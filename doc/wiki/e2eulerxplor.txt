{{{

usage: prog

	Presents a graphical representation of the orientation distribution of the particles in a single particle
	reconstruction. This is displayed as a single asymmetric unit on a sphere, with cylinders of varying height
	representing the number of particles found in each orientation. Middle-click will produce a control-panel
	as usual, and clicking on a single peak will permit viewing the class-average and related projection
	(and particles).

	Normally launched without arguments from a e2workflow project directory.
