||--parallel||str||Standard EMAN2 parallelism option. See http://eman2.org/Parallel||
||--pad|| ||Provide this if the particles in the --particlestack used to create a template, or the template supplied through --template are in a tight box. The size||
||--rotsearch|| ||At each translation position, vary euler angles as well when searching for particles.||
||--tiltangles||str||File in .tlt or .txt format containing the tilt angle of each tilt image in the tiltseries.||
||--tiltaxis||str||Axis to produce projections about. Default is 'y'; the only other valid option is 'x'.||
||--tiltrange||float||Maximum angular value at which the highest tilt picture will be simulated. Projections will be simulated from -tiltrange to +titlrange. For example, if simulating a tilt series collected from -60 to 60 degrees, enter a --tiltrange value of 60. Note that this parameter will determine the size of the missing wedge.||
||--nslices||int||This will determine the tilt step between slices, depending on tiltrange. For example, to simulate a 2 deg tilt step supply --nslices=61 --tiltrange=60. Recall that --tiltrange goes from - to + the supplied value, and that there is a central slice or projection at 0 deg, for symmetrical tilt series.||
||--pruneccc|| ||Pruned based on ccc mean and sigma.||
||--nbins||int||Used for histogram plot. Default=0 (not used). Number of bins for histogram. If not provided, the optimal bin number will be automatically calculated based on bin-width, computed using Scott's normal reference rule, width = (3.5*std)/cuberoot(n), where 'std' is the standard deviation of the distribution of scores and n is the number of values considered. Then, bins will be nbins = (max(scores) - min(scores)) / width.||
||--inverttomo|| ||Multiply --tomogram subsections by -1 to invert the contrast BEFORE looking for particles.||
||--inverttemplate|| ||Multiply --template subsections by -1 to invert the contrast BEFORE looking for particles.||
||--simtemplatesn||int||Number of orientations to simulate templates (that is, --template will be put into --simtemplatesn different orientations, and a 'subtomogram' will be simulated for each through projections by calling e2spt_simulation.py using the information in --angles or --tiltrange and --nslices.||
||--savepreprocessed|| ||Default=False. Will save the intermediate steps of preprocessing of the tomogram.||
||--outmode||str||All EMAN2 programs write images with 4-byte floating point values when possible by default. This allows specifying an alternate format when supported (int8, int16, int32, uint8, uint16, uint32). Values are rescaled to fill MIN-MAX range.||
||--normproc||str||Default=None. Normalization processor (e2help.py processors, applied through e2proc3d.py) applied to the tomogram before looking for particles.||
||--clip||str||IMOD required for this option. Default=None. Provide x,y,z sizes to clip about the center of the tomogram. For example, specify --clip=2048,2048,250 to clip a tomogram originally sized 4096x4096x500 in half, around the center of the tomogram. To clip only in x and y but keep the full thickness in z, you would say --clip=2048,2048. If one variable is omitted, the default size from the tomogram will be used for that axis.||
||--threshold||str||Default=None. Thresholding processor (e2help.py processors, applied through e2proc3d.py) applied to the tomogram before looking for particles.||
||--automask|| ||Default=False. Will automask the tomogram 2 sigmas above mean.||
||--pruneprj|| ||Generate a projection along the z-axis of potential particles, and compare to a projection of the template.||
||--keep||float||Default=0.0 (not used). Percentage of particles, expressed as a fraction, to keep right before writing the coordinates file and output stack.||
||--nkeep||int||Default=0 (not used). Total number of particles to keep right before writing the coordinates file and output stack. Supersedes --keep||
||--tomogram||str||Name of the tomogram.||
||--goldstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few gold particles picked from the tomogram.||
||--ptclstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few sample particles picked from the tomogram, used to create an initial template.
															with which to search for particles throughout the tomogram.||
||--template||str||Default=None. Path to file containing the template 
		to search for particles throughout the tomogram. Alternatively, provide --template=sphere 
		to generate a spherical template from scratch. This requires also setting --boxsize and --ptclradius.
		You can also provide --template=cylinder, which generates a solid or hollow cylinder,
		depending on which of the following options you specify:
		--template=cylinder:radius=r:height=h:radiusinner=ri:heightinner=hi.
		radiusinner and heightinner MUST be specified together, and must be smaller
		than radius and height; otherwise they will be defaulted to radius/2 and height/2.||
||--backgroundstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few boxes picked from regions of the tomogram where there where no particles, 
															no gold, and no carbon.||
||--carbonstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few boxes picked from the grid hole (or carbon).||
||--boxsize||int||Size of the box to put the extracted particles in, and amount by which the subregions will overlap, when searching for particles in the tomogram.||
||--shrinktomo||int||Requires IMOD. Default=0 (no shrinking). Integer factor by which the tomogram will be shrunk.||
||--subsettrans||int||Default=0 (not used). Subset of particles to keep/consider after translational alignment.||
||--dilutionfactor||int||Default=4. Determines how many particles will be pre-picked as putative particles. For example, if
																if the tomogram is broken up into subregions of volume V to look for particles in each
																and --dilutionfactor=1, then, the number of best-correlating subvolumes from the subregion
																that will be initially selected as potential particles will be n=V/(pv*D) where 'pv' is the volume of one particle
																calculated based on --particleradius or --boxsize, or the template's boxsize ['nx']; 'D' is the dilution factor;
																therefore, the larger D is, the fewer locations that will be initially picked as potential particles (before any pruning).||
||--apix||float||The actual apix of the tomogram if for some reason it is wrong on the header.||
||--ptclradius||int||The estimated radius of the particle in pixels.||
||--cshrink||int||If the tomogram was PREVIOUSLY shrunk, --cshrink is the factor by which the tomogram supplied through --tomogram was shrunk with respect to 
														the raw (unshrunk) tomogram. This CAN work in conjuction with --shrinktomo, so be careful. If both parameters are specified,
														the coordinates found by the autoboxer will be multiplied by BOTH factors.||
||--preprocess||str||Any processor (as in e2proc3d.py) to be applied to the tomogram||
||--lowpass||str||A lowpass filtering processor (as in e2proc3d.py) be applied to the tomogram||
||--highpass||str||A highpass filtering processor (as in e2proc3d.py) to be applied to the tomogram.||
||--mask|| ||If provided, a cylindrical mask will be created to mask out the carbon and keep only the grid hole.
															--gridradius and --gridoffest must be specified.||
||--gridradius||int||Radius of the grid in pixels. Supply this parameter only if also supplying --mask.||
||--gridoffset||str||x,y amount of pixels to translate the cylindrical mask if the carbon hole in your tomogram is off center. 
								The left bottom corner would be 0,0. Supply this parameter only if also supplying 
								--mask and the grid hole is not centered in the tomogram.||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higher number means higher level of verboseness||
||--path||str||Directory to store results in. The default is a numbered series of directories containing the prefix 'sptautobox'; 
															for example, sptautobox_01 will be the directory by default if 'sptautobox' already exists.||
||--test|| ||N.A.||
||--templatethreshold||float||A binary threshold will be applied to the template which will zero out all the densities below the supplied value, 
												and will make the densities above the supplied value equal to one.||
||--goldthreshtomo|| ||Zero out all densities above mean of max and min.||
