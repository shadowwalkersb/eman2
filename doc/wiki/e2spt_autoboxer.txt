															through --template are in a tight box. The size||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
||--goldthreshtomo|| ||Zero out all densities above mean of max and min.||
||--threshold||str||Default=None. Thresholding processor (e2help.py processors, applied through e2proc3d.py) applied to the tomogram before looking for particles.||
||--parallel||str||Default=Auto. This program will detect the number of CPU cores on your machine and parallelize some of the tasks using all of them. To disable, provide --parallel=None||
||--tomogram||str||Name of the tomogram.||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
||--ptclstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few sample particles picked from the tomogram, used to create an initial template.
															with which to search for particles throughout the tomogram.||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--preprocess||str||Any processor (as in e2proc3d.py) to be applied to the tomogram||
||--inverttomo|| ||Multiply --tomogram subsections by -1 to invert the contrast BEFORE looking for particles.||
||--normproc||str||Default=None. Normalization processor (e2help.py processors, applied through e2proc3d.py) applied to the tomogram before looking for particles.||
||--subsettrans||int||Default=0 (not used). Subset of particles to keep/consider after translational alignment.||
||--nkeep||int||Default=0 (not used). Total number of particles to keep right before writing the coordinates file and output stack. Supersedes --keep||
||--path||str||Directory to store results in. The default is a numbered series of directories containing the prefix 'sptautobox'; 
															for example, sptautobox_01 will be the directory by default if 'sptautobox' already exists.||
||--lowpass||str||A lowpass filtering processor (as in e2proc3d.py) be applied to the tomogram||
||--simtemplatesn||int||Number of orientations to simulate templates (that is, --template will be put into --simtemplatesn different orientations, and a 'subtomogram' will be simulated for each through projections by calling e2spt_simulation.py using the information in --angles or --tiltrange and --nslices.||
||--nbins||int||Used for histogram plot. Default=0 (not used). Number of bins for histogram. If not provided, the optimal bin number will be automatically calculated based on bin-width, computed using Scott's normal reference rule, width = (3.5*std)/cuberoot(n), where 'std' is the standard deviation of the distribution of scores and n is the number of values considered. Then, bins will be nbins = (max(scores) - min(scores)) / width.||
||--generate_doc|| ||Extract help strings of each command line argument and generate wiki table.||
||--backgroundstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few boxes picked from regions of the tomogram where there where no particles, 
															no gold, and no carbon.||
||--dilutionfactor||int||Default=4. Determines how many particles will be pre-picked as putative particles. For example, if
																if the tomogram is broken up into subregions of volume V to look for particles in each
																and --dilutionfactor=1, then, the number of best-correlating subvolumes from the subregion
																that will be initially selected as potential particles will be n=V/(pv*D) where 'pv' is the volume of one particle
																calculated based on --particleradius or --boxsize, or the template's boxsize ['nx']; 'D' is the dilution factor;
																therefore, the larger D is, the fewer locations that will be initially picked as potential particles (before any pruning).||
||--apix||float||The actual apix of the tomogram if for some reason it is wrong on the header.||
||--shrinktomo||int||Requires IMOD. Default=0 (no shrinking). Integer factor by which the tomogram will be shrunk.||
||--clip||str||IMOD required for this option. Default=None. Provide x,y,z sizes to clip about the center of the tomogram. For example, specify --clip=2048,2048,250 to clip a tomogram originally sized 4096x4096x500 in half, around the center of the tomogram. To clip only in x and y but keep the full thickness in z, you would say --clip=2048,2048. If one variable is omitted, the default size from the tomogram will be used for that axis.||
||--carbonstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few boxes picked from the grid hole (or carbon).||
||--test|| ||N.A.||
||--boxsize||int||Size of the box to put the extracted particles in, and amount by which the subregions will overlap, when searching for particles in the tomogram.||
||--templatethreshold||float||A binary threshold will be applied to the template which will zero out all the densities below the supplied value, 
												and will make the densities above the supplied value equal to one.||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--gridradius||int||Radius of the grid in pixels. Supply this parameter only if also supplying --mask.||
||--automask|| ||Default=False. Will automask the tomogram 2 sigmas above mean.||
||--gridoffset||str||x,y amount of pixels to translate the cylindrical mask if the carbon hole in your tomogram is off center. 
								The left bottom corner would be 0,0. Supply this parameter only if also supplying 
								--mask and the grid hole is not centered in the tomogram.||
||--nslices||int||This will determine the tilt step between slices, depending on tiltrange. For example, to simulate a 2 deg tilt step supply --nslices=61 --tiltrange=60. Recall that --tiltrange goes from - to + the supplied value, and that there is a central slice or projection at 0 deg, for symmetrical tilt series.||
||--tiltangles||str||File in .tlt or .txt format containing the tilt angle of each tilt image in the tiltseries.||
||--mask|| ||If provided, a cylindrical mask will be created to mask out the carbon and keep only the grid hole.
															--gridradius and --gridoffest must be specified.||
||--highpass||str||A highpass filtering processor (as in e2proc3d.py) to be applied to the tomogram.||
||--pruneccc|| ||Pruned based on ccc mean and sigma.||
||--savepreprocessed|| ||Default=False. Will save the intermediate steps of preprocessing of the tomogram.||
||--goldstack||str||Name of the stack containing a few gold particles picked from the tomogram.||
||--inverttemplate|| ||Multiply --template subsections by -1 to invert the contrast BEFORE looking for particles.||
||--template||str||Default=None. Path to file containing the template 
		to search for particles throughout the tomogram. Alternatively, provide --template=sphere 
		to generate a spherical template from scratch. This requires also setting --boxsize and --ptclradius.
		You can also provide --template=cylinder, which generates a solid or hollow cylinder,
		depending on which of the following options you specify:
		--template=cylinder:radius=r:height=h:radiusinner=ri:heightinner=hi.
		radiusinner and heightinner MUST be specified together, and must be smaller
		than radius and height; otherwise they will be defaulted to radius/2 and height/2.||
||--cshrink||int||If the tomogram was PREVIOUSLY shrunk, --cshrink is the factor by which the tomogram supplied through --tomogram was shrunk with respect to 
														the raw (unshrunk) tomogram. This CAN work in conjuction with --shrinktomo, so be careful. If both parameters are specified,
														the coordinates found by the autoboxer will be multiplied by BOTH factors.||
||--tiltaxis||str||Axis to produce projections about. Default is 'y'; the only other valid option is 'x'.||
||--ptclradius||int||The estimated radius of the particle in pixels.||
||--pruneprj|| ||Generate a projection along the z-axis of potential particles, and compare to a projection of the template.||
||--tiltrange||float||Maximum angular value at which the highest tilt picture will be simulated. Projections will be simulated from -tiltrange to +titlrange. For example, if simulating a tilt series collected from -60 to 60 degrees, enter a --tiltrange value of 60. Note that this parameter will determine the size of the missing wedge.||
||--keep||float||Default=0.0 (not used). Percentage of particles, expressed as a fraction, to keep right before writing the coordinates file and output stack.||
||--outmode||str||All EMAN2 programs write images with 4-byte floating point values when possible by default. This allows specifying an alternate format when supported (int8, int16, int32, uint8, uint16, uint32). Values are rescaled to fill MIN-MAX range.||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--rotsearch|| ||At each translation position, vary euler angles as well when searching for particles.||
