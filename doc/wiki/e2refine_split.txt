{{{

usage: prog <output> [options]

	The goal of this program is to reduce the heterogeneity of a reconstruction by splitting a single map
	into two maps, each more homogeneous. You must run e2refine_easy to completion before using this program.
	It will take the class-averaging results from the final iteration, and split the particles from each 
	class-average into 2 groups, producing 2 class-averages for each. The program then attempts to construct
	a maximally self-consistent grouping of these pairs of class averages into 2 3-D maps.
