{{{

usage: e2ptclvsmap.py [options]

This program is used to visually, and somewhat quantitatively, assess how well a set of particles actually agree with a given 3-D map.

Provide a 3-D map, and a set of particles. The program will classify and align all of the particles, matching each with it's best-matching 
projection, very much like the first step in 3-D refinement. Once classified, each particle is compared to its associated projection and
the set of per-projection particles is sorted in order of similarity. An output file is then created containing each projection
followed by a sorted list of associated particles for each.

The reason this script does not just extract similar information from a refine_xx folder is to avoid the map perturbations which occur in
gold-standard refinement.
