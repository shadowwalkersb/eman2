||option||type||description||
||--mass||float||The ~mass of the particle in kilodaltons||
||--randomizemodel|| ||Optionally randomize the phases of the initial model to this resolution (in Angstroms)||
||--thresh||float||Phase Residual cutoff. Particles with a higher phase residual will not be included in the refinement ||
||--reshigh||float||Resolution of the data included in the alignment. This is the high resolution value. ex:25||
||--imem||str||Memory Usage: 0 - Least Memory, 3 - Most memory||
||--rclas||float||High resloution limit used for classification||
||--interp||str||Type of interpolation: 0 - Nearest Neighbor, 1 - Trilinear Interpolation (More Time-Consuming)||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--reslow||float||Resolution of the data included in the alignment. This is the low resolution value. ex:200||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--rrec||float||Resolution of reconstruction in angstroms. It is the resolution to which the reconstruction is calculated.||
||--mode||str||Mode to run FreAlign in: Mode 1 - Refinement and Reconstruction, Mode 3 - Simple Search and Refinement||
||--generate_doc|| ||Extract help strings of each command line argument and generate wiki table.||
||--fbeaut|| ||(T/F)Apply extra real space symmetry averaging and masking to beautify final map prior to output||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--verbose||int||Level of verbose; how much information do you want the program to output?(0-9)||
||--fstat|| ||(T/F)Calculate additional statistics in resolution table at end (QFACT, SSNR, CC, etc.). T Uses more than 50 percent more memory.||
||--ffilt|| ||(T/F)Apply Single Particle Wiener filter to final reconstruction||
