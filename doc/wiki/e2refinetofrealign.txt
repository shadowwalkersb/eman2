||--mode||str||Mode to run FreAlign in: Mode 1 - Refinement and Reconstruction, Mode 3 - Simple Search and Refinement||
||--fbeaut|| ||(T/F)Apply extra real space symmetry averaging and masking to beautify final map prior to output||
||--ffilt|| ||(T/F)Apply Single Particle Wiener filter to final reconstruction||
||--fstat|| ||(T/F)Calculate additional statistics in resolution table at end (QFACT, SSNR, CC, etc.). T Uses more than 50 percent more memory.||
||--reslow||float||Resolution of the data included in the alignment. This is the low resolution value. ex:200||
||--reshigh||float||Resolution of the data included in the alignment. This is the high resolution value. ex:25||
||--rrec||float||Resolution of reconstruction in angstroms. It is the resolution to which the reconstruction is calculated.||
||--rclas||float||High resloution limit used for classification||
||--thresh||float||Phase Residual cutoff. Particles with a higher phase residual will not be included in the refinement ||
