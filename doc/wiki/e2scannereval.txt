usage: prog [options] input.mrc

	Helps to visually assess large images using localized power spectra. Generally
	this is used with scanned images to look for position dependent MTF due to
	film flatness problems or problems with the scanner optics.  However it may also be
	suitable for looking for images with charging or other drift/astigmatism issues. Boxes a grid pattern
	of areas (default 256x256), calculates a power spectrum for each area, then reinserts
	in the image, with a gap between them so the micrograph is still visible in the
	background.
