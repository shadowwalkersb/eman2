usage: prog  <simmx file> <projection file>  <particles file>

	This program allows you to look at per-particle classification based on a pre-computed similarity
	matrix. If a particle seems to be mis-classified, you can use this program to help figure out
	why. It will display a single asymmetric triangle on the unit sphere, with cylinders representing
	the similarity value for the selected particle vs. each possible reference projection. Use the
	normal middle-click on the asymmetric unit viewer for more options.
