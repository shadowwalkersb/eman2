||option||type||description||
||--input||str||The name of the input particle stack||
||--parallel|| ||parallelism argument||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
||--check, -c|| ||Performs a command line argument check only.||
||--normproc||str||Normalization processor applied to particles before alignment. Default is normalize.edgemean. If you want to turn this option off specify 'None'||
||--even|| ||Used by EMAN2 when running eotests. Includes only even numbered particles in class averages.||
||--ref||str||Reference image(s). Used as an initial alignment reference and for final orientation adjustment if present. Also used to assign euler angles to the generated classes. This is typically the projections that were used for classification.||
||--debug, -d|| ||Print debugging infromation while the program is running. Default is off.||
||--force, -f|| ||Force overwrite the output file if it exists.||
||--odd|| ||Used by EMAN2 when running eotests. Includes only odd numbered particles in class averages.||
||--saveali|| ||Writes aligned particle images to aligned.hdf. Normally resultmx produces more useful informtation. This can be used for debugging.||
||--center||str||If the default centering algorithm (xform.center) doesn't work well, you can specify one of the others here (e2help.py processor center)||
||--storebad|| ||Even if a class-average fails, write to the output. Forces 1->1 numbering in output||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--generate_doc|| ||Extract help strings of each command line argument and generate wiki table.||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
||--debug, -d|| ||Print debugging infromation while the program is running. Default is off.||
||--decayedge|| ||Applies an edge decay to zero on the output class-averages. A very good idea if you plan on 3-D reconstruction.||
||--resample|| ||If set, will perform bootstrap resampling on the particle data for use in making variance maps.||
||--resultmx||str||Specify an output image to store the result matrix. This contains 5 images where row is particle number. Rows in the first image contain the class numbers and in the second image consist of 1s or 0s indicating whether or not the particle was included in the class. The corresponding rows in the third, fourth and fifth images are the refined x, y and angle (respectively) used in the final alignment, these are updated and accurate, even if the particle was excluded from the class.||
||--bootstrap|| ||Ignored. Present for historical reasons only.||
||--force, -f|| ||Force overwrite the output file if it exists.||
||--idxcache|| ||Ignored. Present for historical reasons.||
||--nofilecheck|| ||Turns file checking off in the check functionality - used by e2refine.py.||
||--raligncmp||str||The comparitor used by the second stage aligner.||
||--averager||str||The type of averager used to produce the class average.||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--classmx||str||The name of the classification matrix specifying how particles in 'input' should be grouped. If omitted, all particles will be averaged.||
||--ralign||str||This is the second stage aligner used to refine the first alignment. This is usually the 'refine' aligner.||
||--automask|| ||Applies a 2-D automask before centering. Can help with negative stain data, and other cases where centering is poor.||
||--iter||int||The number of iterations to perform. Default is 1.||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--cmp||str||The comparitor used to generate quality scores for the purpose of particle exclusion in classes, strongly linked to the keep argument.||
||--output||str||The name of the output class-average stack||
||--oneclass||int||Create only a single class-average. Specify the number.||
||--dbpath|| ||Ignored. Present for historical reasons.||
||--prefilt|| ||Filter each reference (c) to match the power spectrum of each particle (r) before alignment and comparison||
||--usefilt|| ||Specify a particle data file that has been low pass or Wiener filtered. Has a one to one correspondence with your particle data. If specified will be used to align particles to the running class average, however the original particle will be used to generate the actual final class average||
||--aligncmp||str||The comparitor used for the --align aligner. Default is ccc.||
||--align||str||This is the aligner used to align particles to the previous class average. Default is None.||
||--keepsig|| ||Causes the keep argument to be interpreted in standard deviations.||
||--setsfref|| ||This will impose the 1-D structure factor of the reference on the class-average (recommended when a reference is available)||
||--keep||float||The fraction of particles to keep in each class.||
||--check, -c|| ||Performs a command line argument check only.||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
