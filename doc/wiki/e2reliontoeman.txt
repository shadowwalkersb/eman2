{{{

usage: prog [options] <relion STAR file>

This program will take data from a Relion project and convert it into a basic EMAN2 project. Provide 
the name of the Relion STAR file associated with the raw particle data. An eman2 subdirectory will be
created, and the images, and available metadata will be copied into the new project. CTF parameters
will be extracted from the STAR file and stored as frame CTF parameters. You will still need to run
CTF autoprocessing after importing is complete.
