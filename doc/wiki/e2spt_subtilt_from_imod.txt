{{{

usage: 
	This program extract particles from .ali files from IMOD reconstruction. It takes most information, including XTILT angle and boundary of trimmed volume from IMOD setting and log files. So make sure the whole IMOD project is not corrupted after the reconstruction. This program is test on IMOD 4.7.13 (10/15/2014). There is no garantee that it will work on project generated by any other IMOD versions.
	
	Extracting particles using the box locations saved in the info file corresponding to the tomogram
	[prog] --tomo <tomogram name> --edf <imod edf file> --ptclout <output 2D particle file name> [options]
	
	Extracting particles using 3D particles extracted from the tomogram
	[prog] --ptclin <3D particles> --edf <imod edf file> --ptclout <output 2D particle file name> [options]
