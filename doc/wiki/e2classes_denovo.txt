{{{

usage: prog [options]

	This program is used to produce reference-free class averages from a population of mixed,
	unaligned particle images. Unlike e2refine2d, this program performs only a single pass of classification,
	based entirely on specific low-resolution invariants. Its primary aim is to identify groups of bad particles,
	or rather to separate them from the general population. This program may also tend to split particles by
	defocus if the range within a project is too large.
