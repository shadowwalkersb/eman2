usage: prog [options] <untilted micrograph> <tilted micrograph>....
This is a tilted - untilted particle particle picker, for use in RCT particle picking. A tilted and untilted micrograph are loaded and the user picks a untilted particle and a corresponding tilted particle.
After atleast 3 particle pairs are picked a transformation matrix is completed which can be used to predict the postion of the tilted or untilted particle from a untilted or tilted particle respectily.
From the transform matrix, the tilt angle, tilit axis(with respect to Y) and the gamma angle are all computed. 
The program uses the mediator pattern. The mediator, a RCTboxer object HAS A strategy(itself a strategy pattern), HAS A set of windows(in this case 2, but more can be added), HAS A control pannel, and
HAS a particle list. The strategy object implements the strategy pattern(currently a maunal and a pair picker strategy are implemented). This code is in 'emrctstrategy'. The control pannel object HAS A strategy
widget(so there must be one widget for each strategy) and the strategy GUI widget and the strategy itself are tightly coupled. The window object each HAS A EMBoxList, which is a composite of EMBox objects.
(A class diagram is located in my lab notebook, page16)
Usage: e2RCTboxer.py untilted.hdf tilted.hdf options.
