|| ||usefilt||string||Specify a particle data file that has been low pass or Wiener filtered. Has a one to one correspondence with your particle data. If specified will be used in projection matching routines, and elsewhere.||
|| ||path||string||The name of a directory where results of e2refine_easy.py are placed. If unspecified will generate one automatically of type refine_??.||
|| ||output||string||The name of a directory where the variance calculated should be placed. If unspecified will generate one automatically of type refinevar_??.||
|| ||mass||float||The mass of the particle in kilodaltons, used to run normalize.bymass. If unspecified nothing happens. Requires the --apix argument.||
|| ||apix||float||The angstrom per pixel of the input particles. This argument is required if you specify the --mass argument. If unspecified, the convergence plot is generated using either the project apix, or if not an apix of 1.||
|| ||automask3d||string||The 5 parameters of the mask.auto3d processor, applied after 3D reconstruction. These paramaters are, in order, isosurface threshold,radius,nshells, ngaussshells and nmaxseed. From e2proc3d.py you could achieve the same thing using --process=mask.auto3d:threshold=1.1:radius=30:nmaxseed=10:nshells=5:ngaussshells=5.||
|| ||nmodels||int||The number of different bootstrap models to generate for the variance computation. Default=10||
|| ||iteration||int||The refinement iteration to use as a basis for the variance map||
|| ||volfiles||bool||This will bypass the construction of the individual resampled models, and use files previously generated with the --keep3d options||
|| ||threads||int||Number of threads to run in parallel on a single computer when multi-computer parallelism isn't useful||
|| ||sym||bool||Specify symmetry - choices are: c<n>, d<n>, h<n>, tet, oct, icos||
|| ||classkeep||float||The fraction of particles to keep in each class, based on the similarity score generated by the --cmp argument.||
|| ||classkeepsig||bool||Change the keep ('--keep') criterion from fraction-based to sigma-based.||
|| ||classiter||int||The number of iterations to perform. Default is 1.||
|| ||classalign||string||If doing more than one iteration, this is the name and parameters of the 'aligner' used to align particles to the previous class average.||
|| ||classaligncmp||string||This is the name and parameters of the comparitor used by the fist stage aligner  Default is dot.||
|| ||classralign||string||The second stage aligner which refines the results of the first alignment in class averaging. Default is None.||
|| ||classraligncmp||string||The comparitor used by the second stage aligner in class averageing. Default is dot:normalize=1.||
|| ||classaverager||string||The averager used to generate the class averages. Default is 'mean'.||
|| ||classcmp||string||The name and parameters of the comparitor used to generate similarity scores, when class averaging. Default is 'dot:normalize=1'||
|| ||classnormproc||string||Normalization applied during class averaging||
|| ||classrefsf||bool||Use the setsfref option in class averaging to produce better filtered averages.||
|| ||prefilt||bool||Filter each reference (c) to match the power spectrum of each particle (r) before alignment and comparison||
|| ||pad||int||To reduce Fourier artifacts, the model is typically padded by ~25 percent - only applies to Fourier reconstruction||
|| ||recon||bool||Reconstructor to use see e2help.py reconstructors -v||
|| ||m3dkeep||float||The percentage of slices to keep in e2make3d.py||
|| ||m3dkeepsig||bool||The standard deviation alternative to the --m3dkeep argument||
|| ||m3dsetsf||bool||The standard deviation alternative to the --m3dkeep argument||
|| ||m3diter||int||The number of times the 3D reconstruction should be iterated||
|| ||m3dpreprocess||string||Normalization processor applied before 3D reconstruction||
|| ||m3dpostprocess||string||Post processor to be applied to the 3D volume once the reconstruction is completed||
|| ||keep3d||bool||Keep all of the individual 3-D models used to make the variance map. This make take substantial disk space.||
|| ||lowmem||bool||Make limited use of memory when possible - useful on lower end machines||
||-P||parallel||string||Run in parallel, specify type:<option>=<value>:<option>:<value>||
|| ||ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
