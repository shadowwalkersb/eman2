{{{

usage: prog [options] <stackname1> <stackname2> ...
	This will take selected images from stacks of per-micrograph particles and build "sets", which are pseudo-stack files referencing the images in the original files.
	This supports the old convention where BDB files are used for both particles and stacks as well as the new convention where particles are in HDF files and stacks are in LST format.
	Inputs are a list of micrograph base names, and must be in a "particles" directory. For example, particles/jj1234_ctf_flip.hdf would be specified simply as jj1234. Some
	attempts will be made to correct improper specifications.

	e2buildsets.py dh1234 dh2318 dh7965 --excludebad --setname=myset

	This will look in the particles directory for files such as:
	dh1234_ptcls
	dh1234_ptcls_ctf_flip
	...

	and build a separate set for each type (_ctf_flip, _wienesr, ...)
